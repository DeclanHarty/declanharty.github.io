<h1> Declan Harty - Terrible Web Dev </h1>

<body> 
    <P>Hi, this is a terrible website as you can see. I barely remember how to use HTML, and I had a whole web internship. That clearly helped.
    Anyways, this is a website run entirely on through github. It's free so it has to be good right?</P><br>

    <P>Regardless, like the heading says, my name is Declan Harty. I went to Milton Hershey School in Hershey, PA which is about 7 hours away from where I actually live.</P>
    
    <P>Here is a picture of the school.</P><br>

        <figcaption>Looks great right?  WRONG...</figcaption>

    <p>Mostly what I do as a hobby is play the guitar and program terrible video games. <br>
        Occasionally I will get something that works, but its usually just a knockoff of something that already exists.<br>
        That did help me get into making pixel art though and I have a few things that I made that I'm semi proud of.
