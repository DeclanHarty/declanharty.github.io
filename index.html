<h1> Declan Harty - Terrible Web Dev </h1>

<body> 
    Hi, this is a terrible website as you can see. I barely remember how to use HTML, and I had a whole web internship. That clearly helped.
    Anyways, this is a website run entirely on through github. It's free so it has to be good right?

    Regardless, like the heading says, my name is Declan Harty. I went to Milton Hershey School in Hershey, PA which is about 7 hours away from where I actually live. 
    
    Here is a picture of the school.
